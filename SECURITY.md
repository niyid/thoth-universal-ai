## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability or any other security issue in this project, please follow the steps below:

1. **Do not disclose the issue publicly.**
2. **Email us directly at [security@thoth.ai](mailto:security@thoth.ai)** with the following information:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce it (if possible)
   - The potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes

We aim to respond to all security reports within 72 hours.

## Responsible Disclosure

We strongly support the practice of responsible disclosure. When a vulnerability is reported to us, we commit to:

- Acknowledging receipt of the report within 72 hours
- Investigating the report promptly
- Providing a resolution or mitigation plan as soon as possible
- Crediting reporters in release notes if desired

## Scope

The following components of the Thoth project are in scope for security reports:

- Android, iOS, and React Native apps

- Plugin Manager and memory subsystems

Reports regarding social engineering, phishing, or denial-of-service attacks (DoS) may be acknowledged but are generally out of scope unless they result from application-level code weaknesses.
